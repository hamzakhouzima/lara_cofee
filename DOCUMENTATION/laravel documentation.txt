 		$table->string('id')->primary();
            $table->foreignId('user_id')->nullable()->index();
            $table->string('ip_address', 45)->nullable();
            $table->text('user_agent')->nullable();

1-composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel projectname
2-web.php
3-php artisan make:migration create_table_name
4-Route::get('/', function () { return view('welcome'); });
5-$user = auth()->user();
6-A controller is used to handle HTTP requests and return a response.
7-$users = App\User::all();
8-return view('welcome');
9-php artisan make:seeder UsersTableSeeder
10-php artisan migrate

about:  5-$user = auth()->user();

For example, you might use auth()->user() in a controller to access the currently authenticated user's email address: $email = auth()->user()->email;

It's important to note that this function will return null if no user is currently authenticated.

a laravel controller is a file where we define a function and it's logic and then we execute it in router when the router in fired 
example :
we have a controller named myController , we define a method named controllerMethod which echo 'hello from controller' , 
after creating a route called "firecontroller" " route:get('firecontroller' [myController:class,'controllerMethod'] ) ", controllerMethod method is gonna be executed .

In Laravel, middleware provides a convenient mechanism for filtering HTTP requests entering your application. For example, you may need to verify that the user is authenticated before they can access certain areas of your application.

Examples of middleware in Laravel include:

1. Authentication: Verifies that the user is authenticated before allowing access to certain routes.

2. CORS: Allows requests from other domains (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

3. CSRF: Validates requests to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

4. Rate Limiting: Prevents a user from making too many requests in a given period of time.

5. Encryption: Encrypts the data that is stored in the session.

To add a new column to a table wen need to create a new migration file using 
~//:php artisan make::migration add_price_to_tablename_table

Then we add the the columns details .

Eloquent Models in Laravel provide several methods for querying and manipulating data in the database. Some common methods include:

--all(): retrieves all records from the associated database table.

--find($id): retrieves a single record by its primary key ID.

--where($column, $operator, $value): adds a basic where clause to the query, used to filter records based on specific conditions.

--orWhere($column, $operator, $value): adds an OR where clause to the query.

--first(): retrieves the first record from the query.

--get(): retrieves all records from the query.

--create($attributes): creates a new record in the database with the specified attributes.
 
--update($attributes): updates an existing record in the database with the specified attributes.

--delete(): deletes the record from the database.

--save(): saves the model instance to the database, either creating a new record or updating an existing one, depending on whether the model has a primary key value.

In addition to these methods, Eloquent provides several other features such as relationships between models, eager loading, and more, which can make it easier to perform complex database operations with ease.

[StudentsController::class, 'index'] instead of "StudentsController@index" worked perfectly

// Generates a URL to the specified route
$url = url('route-name');

// Generates a URL to a named route
$url = route('route-name');

// Generates a URL to a controller action
$url = action('ControllerName@actionName');

// Generates a URL to a path
$url = url('/path');
